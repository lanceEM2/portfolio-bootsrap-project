        <div class="col-md-12 bg-dark text-white">My project talks about science and technology in our current world.  It show how technology and science have evolved and how they help us as humans in any sector. Examples include biomedical engineering, space, genetics, quantum computing, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and electric cars. Electric cars have appeared in later years and are now almost replacing fuel driven cars now in Europe and the world. This reduces pollution in the world. Biomedical engineering helps those with disabilities and those with organ problems. Genetics is used to study our DNA and chromosomes, this will help in building more compatible medicines in the future. This site also talks about the Andromeda galaxy which will collide with our Milky way galaxy in a billion years from now but, this will not cause a catastrophe. Artificial Intelligence has proven to be quite effective in our modern and ever evolving world. It is used in self-driven cars, managing large amounts of data and even in calculating and predicting things which our humans brains cant do. Most companies have replaced humans with artificial intelligence robots which handle tasks more effectively than humans since they don't tire. Quantum computers are now replacing our 1's and 0's computers. These quantum computers will be much powerful than most supercomputers in the present world. These computers will change the computer technology sector of the world to a new era. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer products, energy, materials and manufacturing. Nanotechnology refers to engineered structures, devices, and systems. Nanomaterials have a length scale between 1 and 100 nanometers. At this size, materials begin to exhibit unique properties that affect physical, chemical, and biological behavior. Researching, developing, and utilizing these properties is at the heart of new technology. This technology promises us a greater future.</div>
